		<h2>News</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>03/2020</strong>: Patreon stopped delivering filenames to some attachments; a new setting below lets you download affected files anyway.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>03/2020</strong>: Your settings below would be forgotten after a short while; that's fixed now!
		<p>
			<strong>02/2020</strong>: Thank you for trying Patreon Helper. I hope you'll find this tool helpful in saving you a bit of manual work.<br />
			Please note that it is really just a helper and might easily miss attachments or linked media along all the odd and countless ways Patreon constructs posts and links. Always check on your helper's success!

			<span><strong>Error</strong>: Your current configuration could not be loaded. It is uncertain if the settings below this message will work correctly. Please excuse the inconvenience and consider filing in a bug report at <a href="https://github.com/dogpixels/patreon-helper/issues" target="_blank">https://github.com/dogpixels/patreon-helper/issues</a>.</span>

				<input type="checkbox" id="downloadAttachments" name="downloadAttachments" />
				<span><strong>Download Attachments</strong>: Some attachments can only be downloaded in a quirky way that will bother you with a "Save As" dialog for each single file and also download them multiple times to a LostAndFound directory. Enable this option if you don't mind confirming this inconvenience and want to get those additional attachments, too. Otherwise Patreon Helper will ignore them.</span>

				<input type="checkbox" id="useLostAndFound" name="useLostAndFound" />
				<span><strong>Use Lost&Found Directory</strong>: Patreon Helper sometimes cannot identify a file name and whether this file has already been downloaded. In such cases, and if this option is enabled, those uncertain files will be downloaded to <code>{ArtistName}_LostAndFound</code> every time you surf Patreon.</span>
